# Maze Search Visualizer

This project demonstrates three classic search algorithms—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search—on a randomly generated maze. It can optionally visualize the search process using Matplotlib.

## Features

- Randomly generated maze with start and treasure positions
- Implements BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms
- Measures and prints the time taken by each algorithm
- Optionally visualizes paths with `matplotlib`
